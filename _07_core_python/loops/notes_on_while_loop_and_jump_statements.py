#while loop
'''
 while loop is used for indefinite loops where the number of iterations is not known.

It executes a target statement repeatedly as long as the given condition is true.

As soon as the condition becomes false, it stops the execution of the loop and passes
the control to the statement immediately following the while loop.
there is no built-in loop control variable with a while loop

#pass statement
'''
In Python, pass is a null statement. The interpreter does not ignore a pass 
statement, but nothing happens and the statement results into no operation.
The pass statement is useful when you don't write the implementation of a function,
 but you want to implement it in the future.
